sample code ( https://github.com/chitholian/AI-Search-Algorithms)
    -> Submit the link and the code file
2- Apply the Romania problem (graph in ppt ) and find a solution to reach goal
     -> 
3- apply BFS, DFS, and  Iterative deepening
4- add a way to visualize the iterations and the nodes that are checked.
